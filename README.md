## Symbiotic Landscape Generator

Emerging from the ANIMAIS artist residency, Symbiotic Landscape Generator is a web-based performance that generates symbiotic sequences of textual and visual landscapes in real time. Considering the multidimensional acceptances of “landscape” and the residency's focus of thinking in terms of “nature-culture” hybrids, the generated landscapes sequences seek to challenge the traditional Western division by speculating on the intrinsic interconnection between both. With formal reference to experimental cinema and its techniques, this web-based performance also explores the interaction between human and artificial creativity, by combining creative coding practices with generative artificial intelligence models.
